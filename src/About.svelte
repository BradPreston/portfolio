			<h1>My story</h1>
			<div class="my-story">
				<p>I am a passionate web developer with a focus on small and growing businesses. I believe that small companies should have access to beautiful, robust, and efficient websites.</p>
			
				<p>I love seeing companies join the modern web world. Working with me means that you get to work hands on with a developer who cares about you and your business.</p>
			
				<p>One of my better traits is my desire to constantly learn and grow. I like to take online courses, read books, and listen to podcasts to stay up to date on modern web technologies.</p>
			
				<p>In my free time, I like to play guitar, read books, and participate in outdoor activites like camping, inline hockey, and skateboarding. I'm also always on the hunt for the best tasting coffee.</p>
			
				<p>My prefered front-end stack to work in is Svelte, scss, and TypeScript. I'm learning how to build the back-end using Node, Koa, and PostgreSQL. Although this is my desired stack, I am always interested in learning new technologies. </p>
			
				<p>I am currently searching for a career in web development and I am always available for freelance work. Please reach out to me if you'd like to hire me to build your website or want to add me to your team!</p>
